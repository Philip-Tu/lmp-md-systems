This repository contains .in (and related/supplementary) files that would mostly setup, execute, and analyze different molecular dynamics simulation systems using LAMMPS. A `lib` directory is included to mainly store (Python) files for various applications, including data post-processing.

Reposited .in files are generally final, but could be subjected to changes that could potentially improve included simulations.
